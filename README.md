Data Structures Implemented in Go
---------------------------------

While brushing up on implementing different data structures, I decided to implement a simple version of each in Golang.

# Installation

Install like you would any other package:

```go get github.com/fabioberger/data-structures```

Add the data structure you want to use into you project's imports:

```import "github.com/fabioberger/data-structures/queue"```

# Example Usage

Coming soon!
